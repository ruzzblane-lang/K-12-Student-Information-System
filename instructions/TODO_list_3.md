K-12 SIS – Payment Gateway & Yearbook Module Expansion  
 Scope: Extend backend to include modular Payment Gateway API and Yearbook archival system, ensuring airtight security, compliance, and future-proof extensibility.  
---

## 1\. Payment Gateway API (Fort Knox Edition)

### 1.1 Core Architecture

* Scaffold modular Payment Gateway API with provider adapters (Stripe, PayPal, Adyen, etc.).

* Build Payment Orchestration Layer to handle routing, retries, fallbacks, fraud checks, and logging.

* Ensure full multi-tenant isolation of payment data.

* Implement white-label support for branded payment flows per school/district.

* Support multi-currency transactions with automatic exchange handling.

* Add sandbox/test mode for school administrators.

### 1.2 Compliance (Paranoia Mode)

* PCI DSS Level 1 compliance (use hosted fields/tokens—never store card numbers).

* GDPR, CCPA, FERPA, COPPA, and LGPD audit coverage.

* PSD2 compliance for EU (SCA \+ 2FA via provider APIs).

* SOC 2 Type II aligned logging and auditing.

* Canada: Interac compliance.

* Australia: ASIC regulations, Consumer Data Right alignment.

* Bank-level KYC/AML checks where required.

* Tokenize all sensitive data, double-encrypt vault for transaction metadata.

* Add data residency support (EU data in EU servers, etc).

* Publish audit trail logs for every transaction with tamper-proof hashing.

### 1.3 Payment Methods – Global Coverage

#### Universal

* Credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, AmEx, Discover, JCB, UnionPay).

* Debit cards (global networks \+ Maestro).

* PayPal.

* Apple Pay / Google Pay.

* Bank transfers (SWIFT, ACH).

* E-Wallets (Alipay, WeChat Pay, Venmo, Cash App, Payoneer).

#### Region-Specific

* US/Canada: Interac, ACH direct debit.

* EU/UK: SEPA, iDEAL, Giropay, Bancontact, Sofort.

* Australia/NZ: POLi, PayID, BPAY.

* Asia-Pacific: GrabPay, GoPay, OVO, Dana.

* India: UPI, Paytm, PhonePe.

* Latin America: Boleto Bancário (Brazil), OXXO (Mexico), Pix (Brazil).

* Middle East: Mada, Fawry, STC Pay.

### 1.4 Alternative Payment Submission

* Build Manual Payment Request Form:

  * User selects payment type (Bank, Card, E-Wallet, Other).

  * User fills in required info (IBAN, routing number, wallet ID, etc.).

  * System creates Payment Approval Ticket for school administrators.

  * Admin can approve/reject request; decision logged and auditable.

* Add fraud-prevention workflows (flag suspicious manual entries).

### 1.5 Security Features

* End-to-end encryption (AES-256 \+ TLS 1.3).

* HSM-based key management.

* Enforce strict RBAC \+ MFA for payment admins.

* Zero-trust principles for all payment microservices.

* Continuous fraud detection using velocity checks, anomaly scoring.

* Automatic lockout and alerting for suspicious activity.

* Immutable ledger replication (blockchain-style hashing for audit logs).

## 2\. Yearbook Archival System

### 2.1 Core Backend

* Scaffold Yearbook API for uploading, managing, and archiving digital yearbooks.

* Support multiple formats (PDF, EPUB, web components).

* Store in secure, tenant-specific object storage (e.g., S3 buckets with encryption).

* Add access controls (students, parents, alumni, public).

* Enable per-year archival with automatic versioning.

### 2.2 Frontend Integration (Optional)

* Provide schools with a Yearbook Portal Widget (white-label enabled).

* Fun browsing UI: flipbook style, search by name/class, signatures/comments.

* Allow schools to embed yearbooks in their public website.

* Add support for photo uploads and tagging (student names, clubs, events).

* Optional alumni portal extension for long-term access.

### 2.3 Compliance & Security

* Verify FERPA compliance—no sensitive data published without school consent.

* Add opt-in/opt-out for student photos.

* Encrypt archived files at rest.

* Enable watermarking to prevent unauthorized duplication.

* Support retention policies (auto-delete after X years if required by law).

## 3\. Integration Roadmap

1. Scaffold Payment Gateway API core structure (providers, orchestration, security baseline).

2. Add global payment providers with modular adapters.

3. Implement compliance automation (logging, residency, audit).

4. Build Yearbook Archival backend with object storage and APIs.

5. Add optional Yearbook frontend module (white-label widget).

6. Expand to manual payment approval flows with school-side approval tickets.

7. Harden security posture (fraud detection, immutable audit trails).

---

## 4\. Stretch Goals

* AI-based fraud detection (machine learning anomaly detection).

* Smart contract escrow for tuition fees.

* NFT-style signed yearbooks (novel alumni engagement).

* Direct tie-in with local tax compliance systems (US IRS, EU VAT, AUS GST).

---

## 5\. Final Vision

The SIS evolves into a complete academic \+ financial \+ cultural platform, blending:

* Rock-solid compliance and payment processing.

* Fun, community-driven yearbook preservation.

* White-label branding for every tenant.

* A backend so secure that auditors will nickname it Digital Fort Knox for Schools

Key rules:  
\- Do not attempt to implement everything in TODO\_list\_3.md at once.  
\- Each section (Payment Gateway API, Yearbook Archival System, Compliance, Security) must be treated as separate milestones.  
\- For now, only scaffold the documentation, directory structures, and placeholder files as needed so that developers have a clear roadmap.  
\- Implementation of any deliverable from TODO\_list\_3.md must only occur after explicit instruction.  
Update README.md to include a new section called "Future Backlog / Expansion Modules."    
\- Reference TODO\_list\_3.md as the authoritative backlog for upcoming features.    
\- Clearly state that TODO\_list\_3.md is not an implementation checklist but a roadmap of possible future modules.    
\- Add a short summary of the two main areas covered:    
  1\. Payment Gateway API with global compliance, multi-method support, and security hardening.    
  2\. Yearbook Archival System with optional frontend integration.    
\- Include a warning that none of these features should be implemented until explicitly instructed, to prevent premature commits.  
\- Make sure TODO\_list\_3.md is cross-linked in README.md so future developers know it exists and understand its backlog status. Update the repository with TODO\_list\_3.md exactly as written, but treat it strictly as a BACKLOG, not an active implementation task list.
