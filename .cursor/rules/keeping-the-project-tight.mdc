  After generating ten code files (including scripts, modules, or configuration files), you must:
    - Conduct a comprehensive project analysis to identify and resolve all outstanding issues, warnings, alerts, and bugs.
    - Perform a brief audit of the project structure, code quality, and documentation to ensure the project remains well-organized, maintainable, and meets enterprise-grade standards.
    - Document any actions taken, improvements made, and remaining concerns.
    - Only proceed with further code generation after confirming the project is in a healthy, production-ready state.
  This process ensures continuous quality control and prevents technical debt accumulation as the project scales.
