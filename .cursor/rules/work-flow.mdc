  To optimize workflow efficiency, proactively identify all repetitive or manual tasks that can be automated. For each such task:
    - Design and implement scripts or automation tools to handle the process.
    - Launch and execute all automation scripts yourself, ensuring they run reliably and as intended.
    - Monitor script execution and verify successful completion.
    - Document each automated workflow, including script purpose, usage, and troubleshooting steps.
    - Regularly review workflows to identify new automation opportunities and update scripts as needed.
  This approach ensures maximum efficiency, reduces manual errors, and allows the team to focus on higher-value strategic work.
