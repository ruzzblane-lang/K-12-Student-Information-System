rule: |
  When generating or modifying files, you must only write between three to five files at a time in a single operation. 
  If you reach the five file limit, pause and check in with the user before proceeding further.
  This rule applies to all automated code generation, migrations, or bulk file operations.
  Do not exceed five files per batch without explicit user confirmation to continue.
