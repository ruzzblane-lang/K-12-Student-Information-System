## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Compliance Engine**: Central orchestration of all compliance operations
2. **Data Tokenization Service**: Secure tokenization of sensitive data
3. **Encryption Vault**: Double-encrypted storage for sensitive data
4. **Audit Trail Service**: Tamper-proof audit logging
5. **Data Residency Service**: Regional data handling controls
6. **KYC/AML Service**: Identity verification and risk assessment
7. **PCI DSS Service**: Payment card data security

## Implementation

### Data Flow

1. **Data Collection**: Sensitive data is collected through secure forms
2. **Tokenization**: Data is immediately tokenized using secure tokens
3. **Encryption**: Data is double-encrypted and stored in secure vault
4. **Audit Logging**: All operations are logged with cryptographic integrity
5. **Access Control**: Strict role-based access controls
6. **Data Residency**: Data is processed only in approved regions

### Database Setup

Run the compliance migration to create all necessary tables:

```sql
-- Run migration 025_create_compliance_tables.sql
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Compliance Monitoring

The system includes comprehensive monitoring for:
- Compliance violations
- Security incidents
- Data residency violations
- Audit trail integrity
- Tokenization failures
- Encryption issues

### Alerting

Alerts are generated for:

- Security breaches
- Data residency violations
- Audit trail tampering
- Failed compliance checks

## Testing

### Test Suite

Run the compliance test suite:

```bash
npm test -- --grep "compliance"
```
