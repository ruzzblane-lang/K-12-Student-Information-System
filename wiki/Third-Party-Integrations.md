# Third-Party API Integrations Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive, modular third-party API integrations framework for the School SIS system. The framework provides secure, tenant-configurable integrations with role-based access control and full compliance monitoring.

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Modular Architecture
- **Self-contained integrations**: Each provider is isolated and can be enabled/disabled per tenant
- **Plugin-based system**: Easy to add new integrations without affecting existing ones
- **Service-oriented design**: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated services

### ✅ Security & Compliance
- **AES-256-GCM encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **Tenant-specific encryption keys**: PBKDF2-derived keys for maximum security
- **Comprehensive audit logging**: Full activity tracking for FERPA/GDPR compliance
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in protection against API abuse
- **Webhook signature validation**: Secure webhook processing

### ✅ Multi-Tenant Support
- **Tenant isolation**: Each school can configure integrations independently
- **Role-based permissions**: Fine-grained access control (Admin, Teacher, Student, Parent, Staff)
- **Configuration management**: Secure storage and retrieval of tenant-specific settings
